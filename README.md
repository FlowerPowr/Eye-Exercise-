<h1>Eye Movement Tracker Exercise </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
My task for this project was to add a second “eye” element and have that element follow the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events.
Here are the functionalities I interacted with...
- <b>click: Triggered when the mouse is clicked</b>
- <b>mousemove: Triggered when the mouse moves over an element</b>
- <b>mouseleave: Triggered when mouse the leaves an element</b>

How to Run: Move your mouse and the eyes will follow!!

Roadmap of future improvements: I would like to actually integrate this in a form of some sorts, and or maybe use the functionality to create other similar types of fun animations.
